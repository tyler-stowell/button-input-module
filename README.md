# button-input-module

When pin 18 of the raspberry pi goes high, an interrupt is processed that turns pin 17 to high. For some reason the makefile in github is saving the tabs as spaces, so when first cloning this repo and running make, there is an error until the spaces are deleted and replaced with tabs.
